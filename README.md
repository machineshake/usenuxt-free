Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps to get UseNuxt up and running:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://yourrepository.com/nuxt-app.git

```

## Environment Setup üå≥

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file and update the following variables:

   - `NUXT_PUBLIC_URL`: Set this to your local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
   - `NUXT_PUBLIC_NAME`: Set your project name
   - `NUXT_DATABASE_URL`: Set your PostgreSQL connection string

3. Obtain and set up the following API tokens:

   - Google OAuth credentials:
     - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
     - Create a new project or select an existing one
     - Enable the Google+ API
     - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
     - Set `NUXT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `NUXT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in your `.env` file

   - Stripe API keys:
     - Sign up for a [Stripe account](https://stripe.com) or log in to an existing one
     - Go to the Developers section and find your API keys
     - Set `NUXT_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `NUXT_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in your `.env` file
     - To get the `NUXT_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, you'll need to set up a webhook in the Stripe dashboard and use the provided secret

   - (Optional) Plausible Analytics:
     - If you want to use Plausible for analytics, sign up at [Plausible.io](https://plausible.io/)
     - Set `PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN` and `PLAUSIBLE_API_HOST` in your `.env` file

Remember to keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control.
## Database Setup üóÑÔ∏è

This project uses PostgreSQL as its database. Follow these steps to set up your database:

1. Install PostgreSQL:
   - For macOS, you can use Homebrew: `brew install postgresql`
   - For Windows, download and install from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
   - For Linux, use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install postgresql` for Ubuntu)

2. Create a new PostgreSQL database for your project.

3. Update the `NUXT_DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection string. It should look something like this:
   ```
   NUXT_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name"
   ```

4. Run the database setup scripts:
   ```
   npm run db:push
   npm run db:gen
   ```
   These commands will create the necessary tables in your database and generate the required artifacts for Drizzle ORM.

The project uses Drizzle ORM to manage the database schema and operations. User management tables will be automatically created and managed by the Lucia auth library.
